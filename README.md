# 🏥 Diabetes Readmission Analysis (Python Project)

This project analyzes the **Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset** (UCI Machine Learning Repository).  
It is a **Python-only project (no ML)** designed to showcase **core Python concepts** through real-world healthcare data.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Load, clean, and analyze patient hospitalization data.
- Extract meaningful insights about **readmissions, medications, and hospital stays**.
- Demonstrate **Python fundamentals** in a structured, professional way.

---

## 🛠️ Features
✔️ Load CSV dataset with safe error handling  
✔️ Clean missing/invalid data  
✔️ Summarize dataset (patients, diagnoses, admissions)  
✔️ Analyze readmission patterns  
✔️ Calculate average hospital stay  
✔️ Filter patients by prescribed medications  
✔️ Save results to a **report file**

## 🧩 Python Concepts Demonstrated
This project covers the following Python basics:

- **Strings (`str`)** → cleaning column names, handling missing values  
- **Lists (`list`)** → storing patient records, list comprehensions  
- **Sets (`set`)** → finding unique patients, diagnoses, admissions  
- **Dictionaries (`dict`)** → each row stored as a dictionary, summary outputs  
- **File Handling** → reading CSV, writing reports  
- **Exception Handling** → missing/corrupt files handled gracefully  
- **Functions** → modular reusable functions  
- **Lambda Functions** → used with `map`, `filter`, `reduce`  
- **map, filter, reduce** → data transformations and aggregations  
- **Modules & Packages** → code organized into multiple Python files  
- **`*args` / `**kwargs`** → flexible function arguments (`filter_by_medication`)
